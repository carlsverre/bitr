Readme
======
This will eventually be filled out...  All you need to know is that this
project uses node.js (which you will need to get) and then you have to 
initialize the submodules in the repo:

	$ git submodule init
	$ git submodule update

The final step is coping conf.js.example to conf.js and filling it out.

Then just run "node index.js" and your off to the races!
